NTHU L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X Template
=========================================

NTHU lacks a high-quality L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X template, and I made mine.

NTHU Logo

The logo is fetched from [NTHU website](http://www.nthu.edu.tw/intro/aboutnthu1-1.php) and converted from Adobe Illustrator format to Encapsulated PostScript format.
